# Tasks MCP Server PoC

This is a PoC project demonstrating the integration of a **.NET Minimal API** for managing tasks with a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server**. The MCP server can interact with the API using tools, allowing AI models or other agents to manipulate tasks in natural language.

## Project Structure

- /Tasks.Api - Minimal API project (CRUD + search + overdue tasks + notifications)
- /Tasks.McpServer - MCP server using .NET and TasksApiClient

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET    | `/api/tasks` | Retrieve all tasks |
| GET    | `/api/tasks/{id}` | Retrieve a task by ID |
| POST   | `/api/tasks` | Create a new task |
| PUT    | `/api/tasks/{id}` | Update an existing task |
| DELETE | `/api/tasks/{id}` | Delete a task |
| GET    | `/api/tasks/search/{query}` | Search tasks by title or description |
| GET    | `/api/tasks/overdue` | Get tasks that are overdue and not completed |
| GET    | `/api/notifications` | Retrieve notifications generated by task actions |

## MCP Tools

The MCP server exposes the following tools to interact with the Task API:

| Tool Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `ListTasks` | Retrieves all tasks from the system, including their title, description, due date, and completion status. |
| `GetTask` | Retrieves the details of a specific task by its unique ID. |
| `CreateTask` | Creates a new task with a title, optional description, and optional due date. |
| `UpdateTask` | Updates an existing task by ID. You can modify the title, description, completion status, or due date. |
| `DeleteTask` | Deletes a task by its unique ID. |
| `SearchTasks` | Searches for tasks that match a given query in their title or description. |
| `GetOverdueTasks` | Retrieves all tasks that are overdue and not yet completed. |
| `GetNotifications` | Retrieves all notifications generated by task actions such as creation, updates, or deletion. |

> Each tool uses the `TasksApiClient` to communicate with the API.
